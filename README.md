Mobile device forensics using SQLite

- [GitHub](https://github.com/denisecase/df-mod6-mobile)

This respository includes files used in the Digital Forensics Challenge 
described at [TSPD.md](TSPD.md).

## Tools

- VS Code
- VS Code Extension: SQLite Viewer by Florian Klampfer
- [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)

To install an extension in VS Code, 
go to the Extensions tab and search for the name and author. 

Viewing tables in VS Code (or DB Browser) makes it easier to search and explore the organization.

## Open Example Mozilla Broswer Evidence Folder

We have an example of Mozilla Firefox Browser Evidence Folder in the TSPD folder.

Clone, or fork and clone this repo down to your machine. 
Look for the [TSPD/j3uv3vkf.default/](TSPD/j3uv3vkf.default/) folder. 

## Databases (.sqlite) and Tables

Each .sqlite file is a database. A database can have many tables. 
For example, there is a database file named 
`places.sqlite`. 

This database includes 13 tables. 

For example, there is a  `moz_places` table in the places.sqlite database. 
This table contains information about the user's browsing history, 
including the URLs visited and the date and time of the visit.

## Explore Databases in VS Code

You can browse and search the database files in VS Code by clicking on them with the recommended extension installed.

Click on a .sqlite file (pink icon) to open the table and search the data.

## Explore Databases in DB Browser for SQLite

In DB Browser, use  File / Open Database to open a database file. 

Use the drop-down list to select a table in the database. 

Use the "Execute SQL" tab to run queries. 

For example, you can run a SELECT statement to retrieve data from a table:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM moz_places;
```

We can select just some of the columns - or limit our search to urls that contain http or https.

```SQL
SELECT url, title FROM moz_places;
SELECT url, title FROM moz_places WHERE url LIKE '%http%';
```

Investigators can use SQL queries to search for other types of information, 
e.g., credit card numbers and email addresses. 

We can join tables together by matching fields and using the keyword `JOIN`.

For example, you can use the following query to search for email addresses:

```SQL
SELECT url, title, content FROM places JOIN moz_bookmarks ON moz_places.id = moz_bookmarks.fk WHERE content LIKE '%@%' AND url LIKE 'http%';
```

This query will search for email addresses in the URL or page 
content of websites that start with "http". 

After running a query, use the "Save the results view" icon (to the right of the red circle x ) to save as a CSV file.

Example: out.csv

## Optional SQLite CLI and PowerShell

To install SQLite CLI, see: 
https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/
Download a file similar to: 
sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3410200.zip
(1.91 MiB).
Extract the files and move them as needed, so you have 3 .exe files in C:\sqlite.

Once the CLI is installed, you can use PowerShell and PowerShell scripts to execute SQL. 
See get_places1.ps1 for an example. To try it, open a PowerShell terminal and run:

```PowerShell
.\get_places1.ps1
```

Verify that out1.csv is created.
